3. **VS Code Configuration**: Configure VS Code for Python development and install necessary extensions.
4. **Ngrok Integration**: Install Ngrok and connect it to Dialogflow for local webhook testing.

## Usage
1. Train the chatbot in Dialogflow with sample phrases for currency conversion requests.
2. Run the Python webhook server locally using Flask or another web framework.
3. Expose the local server to the internet using Ngrok.
4. Test the chatbot's currency conversion capabilities through the Dialogflow console or external messaging platforms.

## Deployment
