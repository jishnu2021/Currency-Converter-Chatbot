This project demonstrates how to build a currency converter chatbot using Dialogflow, Python, and VS Code. The chatbot allows users to convert currencies through a conversational interface and is designed to streamline financial transactions.

Features
Integrates with Dialogflow for natural language understanding.
Utilizes Python for webhook fulfillment to handle currency conversion logic.
Developed in VS Code for efficient Python development.
Setup
Dialogflow Setup: Create a new agent in Dialogflow and configure intents and entities for currency conversion.
Python Environment: Install Python and create a virtual environment for the project.
VS Code Configuration: Configure VS Code for Python development and install necessary extensions.
Ngrok Integration: Install Ngrok and connect it to Dialogflow for local webhook testing.
Usage
Train the chatbot in Dialogflow with sample phrases for currency conversion requests.
Run the Python webhook server locally using Flask or another web framework.
Expose the local server to the internet using Ngrok.
Test the chatbot's currency conversion capabilities through the Dialogflow console or external messaging platforms.
Deployment
Deploy the chatbot to cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform or Heroku for production use.
Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated deployment.
